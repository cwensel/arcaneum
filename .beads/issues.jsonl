Collection Type Storage (Qdrant metadata):**\n```python\n# Stored as collection-level metadata in Qdrant\n{\n  \"collection_type\": \"pdf\",  # or \"code\"\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-10-27\",\n  \"created_by\": \"arcaneum\",\n  \"model\": \"stella\"\n}\n```\n\n**2. API Design:**\n\n```bash\n# Collection (Qdrant only)\narc create-collection docs --model stella --type pdf\narc create-collection code --model stella --type code\n\n# Corpus (Qdrant + MeiliSearch) \narc create-corpus docs --type pdf\n# ├─\u003e Creates TYPED Qdrant collection 'docs' (type=pdf)\n# └─\u003e Creates MeiliSearch index 'docs' (with type metadata)\n```\n\n**3. Validation on Index:**\n\n```python\ndef validate_collection_type(collection_name, expected_type):\n    \"\"\"Validate collection type matches expected.\"\"\"\n    metadata = get_collection_metadata(collection_name)\n    actual_type = metadata.get(\"collection_type\")\n    \n    if actual_type != expected_type:\n        raise TypeError(\n            f\"Collection '{collection_name}' is type '{actual_type}', \"\n            f\"cannot index {expected_type} content\"\n        )\n\n# In index_pdfs\nvalidate_collection_type(collection_name, \"pdf\")\n\n# In index_source  \nvalidate_collection_type(collection_name, \"code\")\n```\n\n**4.

New users face complexity before seeing value.\n\n**Current Problems:**\n- Quick Start section requires understanding Docker, services, corpora concept\n- Multiple commands needed before first successful operation\n- No \"30-second demo\" for evaluating the tool\n- Users must navigate to multiple documentation files\n- Setup complexity hidden until users try to follow steps\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\n## 1. Add \"Really Quick Start\" to Root README\n\nAdd a minimal example at the top of README (after Features, before detailed sections):\n\n```markdown\n## Quick Start (5 minutes)\n\nGet started with Arcaneum in three commands:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# 1. Install and verify setup\npip install -e .\narc doctor\n\n# 2. Start services (one command)\narc docker start\n\n# 3. Index and search your code\narc create-collection MyCode --model jina-code --type code\narc index-source ~/my-project --collection MyCode\narc search \"authentication logic\" --collection MyCode\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**First time?** The `arc doctor` command will guide you through any missing prerequisites.\n\nSee [Full Documentation](doc/guides/QUICKSTART.md) for advanced features.\n```\n\n## 2. Simplify Existing Quick Start\n\nMove the current detailed \"Quick Start\" to `doc/guides/QUICKSTART.md` with:\n- Prerequisites section (with troubleshooting links)\n- Step-by-step walkthrough with explanations\n- Common workflows (PDF indexing, code indexing, dual indexing)\n- Advanced configuration options\n- Troubleshooting guide\n\n## 3. Improve README Structure\n\n```markdown\n# Arcaneum\n\n[Brief description]\n\n## Quick Start (5 minutes)\n[3-command minimal example]\n\n## Features\n[Current features section - keep as is]\n\n## Installation\n[Brief install commands, link to detailed guide]\n\n## Common Workflows\n### Search Your Code\n[One example]\n\n### Search PDFs  \n[One example]\n\n### Full-Text Search\n[One example]\n\n[Link to full documentation]\n\n## Documentation\n- [Quick Start Guide](doc/guides/QUICKSTART.md) - Detailed walkthrough\n- [Claude Code Plugin](doc/guides/claude-code-plugin.md) - Plugin usage\n- [RDRs](doc/rdr/) - Technical specifications\n\n## Development\n[Current development section]\n```\n\n## 4. Documentation Dependencies\n\nThis issue depends on:\n- **arcaneum-158** (Docker CLI integration) - Enables `arc docker start`\n- **arcaneum-157** (Model cache location) - Improves `arc doctor` diagnostics\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1. **Phase 1: Immediate improvements (no dependencies)**\n   - Restructure README with clearer sections\n   - Add \"What You Can Do\" examples before setup complexity\n   - Create `doc/guides/QUICKSTART.md` from existing README content\n   - Add troubleshooting section to QUICKSTART\n\n2. **Phase 2: After arcaneum-157, arcaneum-158**\n   - Add \"Really Quick Start\" using simplified commands\n   - Update examples to use `arc docker start`\n   - Enhance `arc doctor` to guide first-time setup\n   - Create video/GIF demos of quick start workflow\n\n3. **Phase 3: Polish**\n   - Add \"Try it without installing\" section (Docker image?)\n   - Create interactive tutorial\n   - Add common use case templates\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n- New users can complete first search within 5 minutes\n- README clearly shows value proposition before complexity\n- `arc doctor` guides users through any setup issues\n- Reduced \"how do I start?\" questions\n\n**Examples from Other Tools:**\n- **ripgrep**: Shows 3 examples before any installation instructions\n- **fzf**: Animated GIF demo at top of README\n- **jq**: Cookbook of common patterns before detailed docs\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Faster time-to-value for new users\n- Clearer value proposition (see results before learning complexity)\n- Better onboarding experience\n- Reduced support burden (self-service via `arc doctor`)\n- Professional appearance (similar to popular CLI tools)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"Claude","created_at":"2025-10-30T09:29:31.007623-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T09:29:31.007623-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:15:54.832849-07:00","source_repo":".","labels":["documentation","onboarding","user-experience"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"arcaneum-159","depends_on_id":"arcaneum-157","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-30T09:29:31.074074-07:00","created_by":"auto-import"},{"issue_id":"arcaneum-159","depends_on_id":"arcaneum-158","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-30T09:29:31.074545-07:00","created_by":"auto-import"}]}

Named Vectors Support\n\n**Collections with Multiple Named Vectors** (from RDR-002):\n- Collections can have multiple embedding models as named vectors\n- Example: `vectors={\"stella\": ..., \"jina\": ...}`\n- Search specifies which vector to use\n\n**Handling Strategy**:\n```python\ndef search_with_named_vector(\n    client: QdrantClient,\n    collection_name: str,\n    query: str,\n    vector_name: str = None,  # Optional: defaults to embedding_model metadata\n    ...\n):\n    # If vector_name not specified, use collection's default model\n    if not vector_name:\n        vector_name = detect_collection_model(client, collection_name)\n    \n    # Generate query embedding\n    model = embedder.get_model(vector_name)\n    query_vector = list(model.query_embed([query]))[0]\n    \n    # Search using named vector\n    results = client.search(\n        collection_name=collection_name,\n        query_vector=(vector_name, query_vector.tolist()),\n        ...\n    )\n```\n\n### 4. Fallback Behavior\n\n**When Model Not Available**:\n1. Check if model in `models_config` (from RDR-003 defaults)\n2. If missing, provide clear error with available models\n3. No silent fallbacks (explicit is better)\n\n```python\ndef get_model_with_fallback(model_key: str) -\u003e TextEmbedding:\n    if model_key not in models_config:\n        available = \", \".join(models_config.keys())\n        raise ValueError(\n            f\"Model '{model_key}' not configured.\\\\n\"\n            f\"Available models: {available}\\\\n\"\n            f\"Add model via config file or use --model flag\"\n        )\n    return get_model(model_key)\n```\n\n### 5. Query Embedding Generation Pipeline\n\n**Full Pipeline**:\n```python\ndef generate_query_embedding(\n    query: str,\n    collection_name: str,\n    client: QdrantClient,\n    embedder: SearchEmbedder\n) -\u003e tuple[str, list[float]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate query embedding for search.\n    \n    Returns:\n        (vector_name, embedding_vector)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Detect model from collection\n    model_key = detect_collection_model(client, collection_name)\n    \n    # Step 2: Get cached model\n    model = embedder.get_model(model_key)\n    \n    # Step 3: Generate query embedding (not document embedding!)\n    query_embeddings = model.query_embed([query])\n    query_vector = list(query_embeddings)[0]\n    \n    # Step 4: Return named vector tuple\n    return (model_key, query_vector.tolist())\n```\n\n**Key Notes**:\n- Use `query_embed()` NOT `embed()` (optimized for queries vs documents)\n- Models generate embeddings lazily (only when first used)\n- Cache persists across CLI invocations (FastEmbed cache_dir)\n- Named vector tuple format: `(vector_name, vector_data)`","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-30T09:29:31.030318-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T09:29:31.030318-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-20T11:30:42.130659-07:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"arcaneum-53","depends_on_id":"arcaneum-7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-30T09:29:31.09727-07:00","created_by":"auto-import"},{"issue_id":"arcaneum-53","depends_on_id":"arcaneum-204","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-30T15:31:34.833953-07:00","created_by":"import-remap"}]}

Mapping to Qdrant Filter API\n\n**Qdrant Filter Structure** (from research):\n```python\nfrom qdrant_client.http import models\n\nfilter = models.Filter(\n    must=[\n        models.FieldCondition(key=\"language\", match=models.MatchValue(value=\"python\"))\n    ],\n    should=[],\n    must_not=[]\n)\n```\n\n**Simplified DSL → Qdrant Mapping**:\n```python\ndef parse_simple_filter(filter_str: str) -\u003e models.Filter:\n    \"\"\"\n    Parse key=value,key=value format to Qdrant Filter.\n    \n    Examples:\n        \"language=python\" → must[FieldCondition(key=\"language\", match=MatchValue(\"python\"))]\n        \"language=python,git_project=myproj\" → must[...two conditions...]\n    \"\"\"\n    conditions = []\n    for pair in filter_str.split(','):\n        key, value = pair.split('=', 1)\n        conditions.append(\n            models.FieldCondition(\n                key=key.strip(),\n                match=models.MatchValue(value=value.strip())\n            )\n        )\n    return models.Filter(must=conditions)\n```\n\n### 3. Supported Operators\n\n**From Qdrant API Research**:\n- `match`: Exact value match\n- `range`: Numeric/date range (gt, gte, lt, lte)\n- `geo_radius`: Geographic distance\n- `values_count`: Count of array elements\n\n**Common Use Cases**:\n\n```python\n# Exact match (most common)\nmodels.FieldCondition(key=\"language\", match=models.MatchValue(value=\"python\"))\n\n# Multiple values (OR within field)\nmodels.FieldCondition(key=\"language\", match=models.MatchAny(any=[\"python\", \"java\"]))\n\n# Numeric range\nmodels.FieldCondition(\n    key=\"chunk_index\",\n    range=models.Range(gte=0, lt=10)\n)\n\n# String contains (for text fields)\nmodels.FieldCondition(key=\"file_path\", match=models.MatchText(text=\"/src/\"))\n\n# Existence check\nmodels.FieldCondition(key=\"git_branch\", match=models.MatchAny(any=[]))  # has field\n```\n\n**Extended DSL for Advanced Cases**:\n```bash\n# Range queries\n--filter \"chunk_index:gte:0,chunk_index:lt:10\"\n\n# Multiple values (OR)\n--filter \"language:in:python,java,javascript\"\n\n# Text search\n--filter \"file_path:contains:/src/\"\n```\n\n### 4. Nested Conditions (AND/OR Logic)\n\n**JSON Format for Complex Logic**:\n```json\n{\n  \"must\": [\n    {\"key\": \"programming_language\", \"match\": {\"value\": \"python\"}}\n  ],\n  \"should\": [\n    {\"key\": \"git_project_name\", \"match\": {\"value\": \"project1\"}},\n    {\"key\": \"git_project_name\", \"match\": {\"value\": \"project2\"}}\n  ],\n  \"must_not\": [\n    {\"key\": \"file_path\", \"match\": {\"text\": \"test\"}}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Semantics**:\n- `must`: All conditions must match (AND)\n- `should`: At least one condition must match (OR)\n- `must_not`: No condition should match (NOT)\n\n**Nested Example**:\n```json\n{\n  \"must\": [\n    {\n      \"should\": [\n        {\"key\": \"language\", \"match\": {\"value\": \"python\"}},\n        {\"key\": \"language\", \"match\": {\"value\": \"java\"}}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\"key\": \"git_project_name\", \"match\": {\"value\": \"myproject\"}}\n  ]\n}\n```\n→ (language=python OR language=java) AND git_project_name=myproject\n\n### 5. Common Use Case Examples\n\n**Example 1: Language Filter**\n```bash\n# Simple\narcaneum search \"auth\" --collection Code --filter language=python\n\n# Qdrant JSON\n--filter '{\"must\": [{\"key\": \"programming_language\", \"match\": {\"value\": \"python\"}}]}'\n```\n\n**Example 2: Project + File Type**\n```bash\n# Simple\n--filter \"git_project_name=myproject,file_extension=.py\"\n\n# Qdrant JSON\n--filter '{\n  \"must\": [\n    {\"key\": \"git_project_name\", \"match\": {\"value\": \"myproject\"}},\n    {\"key\": \"file_extension\", \"match\": {\"value\": \".py\"}}\n  ]\n}'\n```\n\n**Example 3: Multiple Projects (OR)**\n```bash\n# Extended DSL\n--filter \"git_project_name:in:project1,project2,project3\"\n\n# Qdrant JSON\n--filter '{\n  \"must\": [{\n    \"key\": \"git_project_name\",\n    \"match\": {\"any\": [\"project1\", \"project2\", \"project3\"]}\n  }]\n}'\n```\n\n**Example 4: Date Range (Last 30 Days)**\n```bash\n# Extended DSL\n--filter \"upload_date:gte:2025-09-20\"\n\n# Qdrant JSON\n--filter '{\n  \"must\": [{\n    \"key\": \"upload_date\",\n    \"range\": {\"gte\": \"2025-09-20\"}\n  }]\n}'\n```\n\n**Example 5: Exclude Tests**\n```bash\n# Qdrant JSON only (must_not not in simple DSL)\n--filter '{\n  \"must\": [{\"key\": \"language\", \"match\": {\"value\": \"python\"}}],\n  \"must_not\": [{\"key\": \"file_path\", \"match\": {\"text\": \"test\"}}]\n}'\n```\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n```python\ndef parse_filter(filter_arg: str) -\u003e models.Filter:\n    \"\"\"Parse filter from CLI argument.\"\"\"\n    # Detect format\n    if filter_arg.startswith('{'):\n        # JSON format - parse and convert to Qdrant Filter\n        return parse_json_filter(filter_arg)\n    elif ':' in filter_arg:\n        # Extended DSL with operators\n        return parse_extended_filter(filter_arg)\n    else:\n        # Simple key=value format\n        return parse_simple_filter(filter_arg)\n```","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-30T09:29:31.030801-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T09:29:31.030801-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-20T11:31:23.997641-07:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"arcaneum-54","depends_on_id":"arcaneum-7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-30T09:29:31.097788-07:00","created_by":"auto-import"},{"issue_id":"arcaneum-54","depends_on_id":"arcaneum-204","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-30T15:31:34.831362-07:00","created_by":"import-remap"}]}

This causes failures when offline or behind restrictive corporate firewalls/proxies.\n\nRoot Cause:\n1. SentenceTransformer() initialization (client.py:136) does not pass local_files_only=True parameter\n2. No pre-flight cache check before model loading in search flow (unlike indexing which was fixed in arcaneum-bc63)\n3. HuggingFace Transformers library defaults to checking for model updates online\n\nImpact:\n- Search fails with network errors when offline\n- Unnecessary latency from network checks\n- Breaks in corporate environments with restrictive proxies\n- Model is cached but still requires network access\n\nCurrent Behavior:\nSearchEmbedder → EmbeddingClient.get_model() → SentenceTransformer(config['name']) → Network call to HuggingFace\n\nExpected Behavior:\nIf model is cached: SentenceTransformer(config['name'], local_files_only=True) → No network call","design":"Solution Strategy:\n\n1.

Collections grouped under `collection` subcommand\n   - Full-text grouped under `fulltext` subcommand\n   - But `search` is top-level (should it be `collection search`?)\n   - `models` is top-level (logical as shared resource)\n\n3. **Verb consistency:**\n   - `create-index` uses hyphen, but `create` doesn't\n   - `list-indexes` uses hyphen, but `list` doesn't\n\n4. **Missing symmetry:**\n   - `collection info` exists, but no `fulltext info`?\n   - Should there be `fulltext index-info` or similar?\n\n**Proposed Unified Structure:**\n\nOption A (Resource-based grouping):\n```\narcaneum init\narcaneum models {list,download,info}\narcaneum collection {create,list,info,delete,search}\narcaneum index {create,list,info,delete,search}\narcaneum corpus {create,verify,reindex}\n```\n\nOption B (Keep current with consistency fixes):\n```\narcaneum init\narcaneum models {list,download,info}\narcaneum collection {create,list,info,delete}\narcaneum fulltext {create,list,info,delete}\narcaneum search [options]  # Searches collection (semantic)\narcaneum fulltext-search [options]  # Searches index (exact)\narcaneum corpus {create,verify,reindex}\n```\n\nOption C (Action-based top level):\n```\narcaneum init\narcaneum create {collection,index,corpus}\narcaneum list {collections,indexes,models}\narcaneum search {semantic,fulltext,hybrid}\narcaneum delete {collection,index}\narcaneum info {collection,index,model}\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Document current command structure from all RDRs\n- Analyze consistency issues\n- Propose unified structure (with migration path if breaking changes)\n- Consider discoverability via `--help`\n- Consider future extensibility (more search types, more storage backends)\n- Prioritize developer experience and intuitiveness\n- Minimize breaking changes if possible\n\n**Deliverable:**\n- Analysis document or mini-RDR with recommended structure\n- Migration plan if breaking changes needed\n- Updated CLI help text examples","notes":"**Analysis Complete -

Create Qdrant collection: `arcaneum collection create`\n2. Create MeiliSearch index: `arcaneum fulltext create-index`\n3. Index documents to both: `arcaneum index-code` (dual indexing)\nTotal: 3 commands minimum\n\n**What User Actually Wants** (FEWEST COMMANDS):\n\nOption A (Ideal - if not too complex):\n1. `arcaneum create-corpus my-pdfs --type pdf` (creates both collection + index)\n2. `arcaneum sync-directory ./documents --corpus my-pdfs` (indexes to both systems)\nTotal: 2 commands\n\nOption B (Fallback - if Option A is complex):\n1. `arcaneum sync-directory ./documents --vector my-pdfs` (create collection + index to Qdrant)\n2. `arcaneum sync-directory ./documents --fulltext my-pdfs` (create index + index to MeiliSearch)\nTotal: 2 commands (but independent)\n\n**Current RDR Problem:**\n- Focuses on architectural purity (loose coupling, separate commands)\n- Ignores user's actual constraint: MINIMIZE COMMANDS\n- The `create-corpus` wrapper exists but is buried as \"optional\"\n- Doesn't address the sync-directory use case at all\n\n**Required Changes:**\n1. Re-assess complexity of unified collection creation (maybe it's not that hard?)\n2. Design sync-directory command that indexes to both systems\n3.

No rollback needed - if one fails, just error out\n```\n\n**Why we over-estimated complexity:**\n- Assumed we needed distributed transaction semantics (wrong!)\n- Assumed we needed rollback (wrong! just fail fast)\n- Focused on architectural purity over user needs\n\n**Actual Complexity: ~4-6 hours** (just wrap two API calls)\n\n**Sync Directory Design:**\n```python\ndef sync_directory(dir_path, corpus_name):\n    # 1.

This saves significant processing time and avoids duplicate points.\n\nCURRENT BEHAVIOR:\n- Incremental sync uses (file_path, file_hash) tuple to detect changes\n- If file is renamed: old path + hash exists, new path + hash doesn't exist\n- Result: File gets reindexed completely, creating duplicate chunks in collection\n- Old chunks with old path remain in collection (orphaned)\n\nEXAMPLE SCENARIO:\n1. Index 'paper.pdf' → creates chunks with file_path='paper.pdf', file_hash='abc123'\n2. Rename to 'renamed-paper.pdf'\n3. Incremental sync sees new path, computes hash → 'abc123' (same)\n4. Current: Reindexes entire file, creates duplicate chunks\n5. Desired: Detect rename, update metadata only\n\nPROPOSED SOLUTION:\n1. During incremental sync, track files by hash as well as (path, hash) tuple\n2. If hash exists but path changed → rename detected\n3. Update existing chunks' file_path metadata using Qdrant's update API\n4. Skip reindexing\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n- Modify MetadataBasedSync.get_unindexed_files() to return rename candidates\n- Add MetadataBasedSync.handle_renames() method\n- Update file_path payload for all chunks with matching file_hash\n- Use Qdrant's scroll + update API for efficient batch updates\n\nFILES TO MODIFY:\n- src/arcaneum/indexing/common/sync.py: Add rename detection\n- src/arcaneum/indexing/uploader.py: Handle rename candidates before indexing\n- src/arcaneum/indexing/markdown/pipeline.py: Handle renames\n- src/arcaneum/indexing/source_code_pipeline.py: Handle renames (uses git metadata)\n\nEDGE CASES:\n- Multiple files with same hash (real duplicates) - only update if exactly one match\n- File renamed AND modified - should reindex (hash changed)\n- File moved to different directory - treat as rename\n\nBENEFITS:\n- Faster incremental syncs for renamed files\n- No duplicate chunks in collection\n- Clean up orphaned chunks with old paths","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-02T12:41:58.733228-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-02T12:41:58.733228-08:00","source_repo":"."}
